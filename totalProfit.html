*********************TODO*********************
Compare only what you've bought within the trading post, and what you sold:

Assumptions, since you normally buy in bulk the bought array will have less items then the sold array. Example, buying 250 totems will only have 1 entry in the bought array, while it could have 50 in the sold array depending how you listed them in the trading post.

Algorithm:

0) sort both arrays by item_id
1) For the current item_id, make sure it appears in both arrays, otherwise skip it.
2)Get all occurrences of an item (in the loop, keep going until an ID changes) in the bought array.
2) Get all occurrences of an item in the sold array
3) total up the total amount spent vs the amount gained per item
4) total up all items for net value
5) get item names per grouping (separate API call)
5) Plot all data in a nice table, highlight losses in red, gains in green.

Bonus:
Figure out how to do this asynchronously. Notice how the browser freezes up when buttons are clicked now? That is not desired.
